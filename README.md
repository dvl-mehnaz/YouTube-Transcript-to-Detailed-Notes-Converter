Streamlit application designed to convert the transcript of a YouTube video into detailed notes using Google's Gemini Pro model for summarization. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

Environment Setup: The application uses Streamlit for the user interface and imports necessary libraries such as dotenv for loading environment variables, os for accessing system variables, google.generativeai for using the Gemini Pro model, and YouTubeTranscriptApi for fetching transcripts from YouTube videos.

Configuration: It loads the Google API key from environment variables using dotenv and configures the Gemini Pro model for text generation.

User Interface:

The Streamlit app starts with a title "YouTube Transcript to Detailed Notes Converter".
It provides a text input field where users can enter the URL of a YouTube video.
Upon entering a valid YouTube video URL, it displays the video thumbnail using the video ID extracted from the URL.
A button labeled "Get Detailed Notes" triggers the transcript extraction and summarization process when clicked.
Transcript Extraction:

The extract_transcript_details function fetches the transcript of the specified YouTube video using YouTubeTranscriptApi.
It concatenates the text from each transcript entry into a single string.
Summarization:

The generate_gemini_content function uses the Gemini Pro model to generate a summary based on the provided prompt (prompt) and the extracted transcript text.
It appends the prompt to the beginning of the transcript text to guide the summarization process.
Output:

If the "Get Detailed Notes" button is clicked and the transcript extraction is successful, the application displays the generated summary under the heading "Detailed Notes".
This application effectively combines Streamlit's user interface capabilities with Google's AI tools to automate the process of converting YouTube video transcripts into concise, summarized notes, enhancing accessibility and usability for users interested in quickly digesting video content.
